  title={Implementation of a Long-lasting, Untethered, Lightweight, Upper-Limb Exoskeleton},
  author={Liu, H. and Fang, K. and Chen, L. and Xu, C. and Chen, C. and Wang, T. and Wu, Z. and Ye, J. and Fu, C. and Chen, G. and Wang, H.},
  abstract={To prevent muscle fatigue or disorder from long-term or repetitive arm-lifting in manual operations, various exoskeletons have been developed. However, motorized exoskeletons suffer from heavy mass and high cost, while previous passive exoskeletons possess poor adaptability. To solve this problem, we designed a lightweight (3.1 kg) upper limb exoskeleton capable of providing self-adaptable support based on linkage mechanisms and gas springs, with tunable maximum force based on small motors and sensors to adapt to hand loads. The motors adjust the mechanical structure’s dimensions, instead of directly supporting the arms, resulting in low power consumption (1.85 W) and extended operation (11 hours). Experimental results show that the measured surface electromyogram (sEMG) activities reduced up to 43.84% and 46.23% for static and dynamic tests, respectively.},

  title={GRADE: Generating Realistic Animated Dynamic Environments for Robotics Research},
  author={Bonetto, E. and Xu, C. and Ahmad, A.},
  abstract={In this work, we present a fully customizable framework for generating realistic animated dynamic environments (GRADE) for robotics research. The data produced can be post-processed, e.g. to add noise, and easily expanded with new information using the tools that we provide. To demonstrate GRADE, we generated an indoor dynamic environment dataset and then compared different SLAM algorithms on the produced sequences. By doing that, we show how current research over-relies on well-known benchmarks and fails to generalize. Furthermore, our tests with YOLO and Mask R-CNN provide evidence that our data can improve training performance and generalize to real sequences. Finally, we show GRADE's flexibility by using it for indoor active SLAM, with diverse environment sources, and in a multi-robot scenario. The code, results, implementation details, and generated data are provided as open-source. },

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
